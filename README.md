parallel-file-analyzer
======================

Tool which creates and processes files in parallel.

In contrast to [`SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework`](https://github.com/kyledewey/SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework), files can be created on the fly, which is more flexible.

Ultimately, this should replace [`SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework`](https://github.com/kyledewey/SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework).
This could have been written as an extension to [`SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework`](https://github.com/kyledewey/SMP-Parallel-Execution-Framework), but that is so needlessly complex with mostly boilerplate that I want to start fresh.
